From client side we access the internet, and when we interact with content on a site such as clicking a button or searching for something, we are making a request to the server for information.  Server is a database that holds data.
How do we communicate with the server?  Via Protocol namely the Http protocol (rules).  When we make a request to the server for content we are given html, css, and js, these files are processed via the web browser.
Html is the structure and content, CSS is the styling of content, and JS is how it behaves or function or how we can interact with the content.  What the users see's and interacts with is primaraily the work of Front end devlopers.  On the other hand, there is Backend development, which focues on getting the data from the database and then work on the functionality and logic the powers web applications.  Backend languages must be able to serve request, that is communicate with the server. Some languages include: JS, Python, JAVA, and PHP.
